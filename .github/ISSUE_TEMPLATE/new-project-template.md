# Abstract
It's a brand new revamp to the classic (pun intended) game of Tic Tac Toe - can you beat the quantum computers using superposed verions of X's and O's?


# Description <!-- ⚠️ Optional. Remove this section if not needed -->
Guide to TiQ TaQ Toe: quantum Tic Tac Toe!!!!!

The rules are simple - you need to make three in a row of either the zero ket or the one ket. You are not confined to use any one of them

On your move, you can do one of two things: place a superposed qubit in any empty cell, with a superposition state that you can determine
Or, you can chose to make a measurement on three qubits in a line causing them to collapse. If you do this and get three of them to be the same (either 0 or 1 ket), you win!

You also have a superpower, called the SuperMeasure. Use this to measure all qubits on the board at once! However, if the board does not have any three same qubits in a line, you lose - as they say, great power comes with great responsibility :)

You will face off against a qunatum computer in this challenge (yes, definitey a great flew if you win - and even if you don't!)

Do you think you have what it takes to beat the quantum machine! Play to find out!
